        I've spent the last 5+ years working in Customer Success in the tech startup environment.

        <br>
        <br>

        Driven by the ambition to pursue a new career path, I enrolled in
        <strong>Le Wagon's web development bootcamp</strong> in April 2023.

        <br>
        <br>

        The experience, though challenging, has been incredibly rewarding, and one of the best
        decisions I've made in my life. Since completing the bootcamp after a intensive 9 weeks,
        the work and learning has only just begun. I'm driven by a passion for continuous learning,
        constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and grasp the inner workings of the web.

        <br>
        <br>

        With all of my experience in Customer Success, my work is shaped by a deep understanding of client needs and perspective.
